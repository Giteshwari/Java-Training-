I have created the Tables ->
          doctors_table        
          hospitals_table      
          patients_table       
          staff_table
 
 The tables which have been created because of many-to-many relations are ->
          doctors_patientslist
          doctors_stafflist
 
 
 Hospital -> Doctors    has    one-to-many
 Doctors  -> Patients   has    many-to-many
 Doctors  -> Staff      has    many-to-many
